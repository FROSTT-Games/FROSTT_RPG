# FROSTT_RPG Readme

Hey Friend, I’m assuming that if you’re here you know what an RPG is. But if it’s not clear, this project is specifically for Table Top Role Playing Games (TTRPG)s, I just split up the TT because it seemed cool. It’s probably also not clear that the FROS is for “Freely Replicable & Open Source”, though I also like “Fantastical Reality Objective Simulator” and “Fantasy Research & Observation System”. You may ask, “don’t other such systems already exist, things like FATE?” Yes, though I am not aware that they are regularly revised and collaborated on like Open Source Software, which is the vibe I’m going for here. Furthermore, as more research is conducted into collaboration and the benefits of our beloved pastime, I believe that there is space for a system designed to be accessible, customizable, and structured for open use & modification of variables. So, preamble aside, what can you expect here?

### This Is Built To Share

If nothing else, this project is intended to share, expand on, create various branches of, and ultimately remain open in perpetuity for all RPG enthusiasts to enjoy!

### This Is, Begrudgingly, A BDFN

Until better governance can be put in place (with good traction this should happen quickly), this is a Benevolent Dictatorship For Now (as opposed to a [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)). The BDFN is me, @marcusthesmith (@marcus_thesmith in most other social places). As a student of complex collaboration, my first goal is to come up with a way for us all to truly organize and work as peers to build something awesome. As a professional software engineer, that will probably be facilitated by technology. So yes, a [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) is the likely path assuming it can be implemented well… and Web3 doesn’t totally die. 

### Your Contribution IS Appreciated

As the project evolves, the various options for contributors will expand, as will the standards these contributions are held to. The main version (trunk) of the system will always be protected and require approval from a trusted admin (starting with me). That said, anyone who wants to make changes is encouraged to make branches suggesting them (or [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) for your own use). If you just have questions, concerns, or conversations to be had, those can be done in the associated [issue board](https://github.com/FROSTT-Games/FROSTT_RPG/issues). Either way, no matter who you are, there will be at least initial attempts to consider what you have to share. That said, people with the most experience doing this stuff will likely gain the most ear. What will quickly get shut down is any form of promotion of anything that is not specifically for building this TTRPG system. There are other places for such promotions which will probably do you better anyway. Finally, if you don’t know how to use the [GIT version control system](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) (what you’re likely on right now), there are many [great resources](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_intro.asp?remote=github) out there but I can also share a crash course in the future specific to this project.

### There Are Specific Goals For This System

Everyone has their various ideas for what a “perfect” RPG system would look like. I believe there is no Panacea, and there are too many opinions to wrangle especially if the objective is just to create “the next great system”. So, all efforts for the project should align with these goals (which may grow & expand). The better we can accomplish them (though they sit in tension), the more likely this system will last, even as it evolves.

### Goals (in priority):

1. **************************************************Approachability Above All Else**************************************************: It is easy to want all types of modifiers and adjustments for different scenarios. And for the hardcore gamer this is great. However, one of the biggest goals for this system is to be a gateway for players, similar to how 5e was but free to start. This means that it must be at least reasonably approachable. No need to build it for a 5 year old, but consider what the learning curve looks like, and how that may grow with time investment.
2. **This Is A Base System**: We want other designers, world builders, GMs and even researchers to easily take what’s here and make it their own. When building mechanics, think about how things can be inherently balanced and designed to be reskinned easily. If classes are built by a given set of rules, others can easily follow those rules to make their own. Let’s design those rules. Especially a combat and magic framework that works better with various fantasy worlds and types of adventures.
3. **This Is Something New**: This system is meant to throw out a lot of what we know from other systems and ask “how can this be built for everyone to evolve together”. Feel free to share your feelings about something seeming strange, but let biases sit on the sideline. Be willing to lean into things like the following: Given the world we live in, it’s probably better that we call the genetic make of a character lineage instead of race. Do we really NEED to roll against AC for attack? What if there were no skills at all, could that make the game more approachable but still functional? Who knows what the actual outcomes will be, but so long as we remain openminded we are more likely to get to something we can all enjoy.
4. **********************Create Equilibrium:********************** There are many merits to a more narratively driven and a more combat mechanic driven RPG. The goal here is to create something that is structurally sound but empowering to narrative storytelling even in the midst of mechanical structure. If you’re trying really hard to come up with the perfect mechanic, consider if we just told DMs to “have at it” when it comes to that situation and make a narrative decision. We should always attempt to avoid vagueness, but narrative empowerment is always good.

### Getting Started

So you’re interested in contributing to a shared TTRPG system? Feel free to start by voicing thoughts and opinions in the [issue board](https://github.com/FROSTT-Games/FROSTT_RPG/issues). The best thing you can do is think through all the pieces of an RPG you love and ask about how those are considered being done. As with building anything from scratch, it’s easy to forget the little things (like fall damage or magic item rarity). See if work is already being done on something and suggest edits or edge cases to consider. As you engage more you may become a trusted party who moderates others’ input. And if you have any questions whatsoever feel free to reach out @marcusthesmith
